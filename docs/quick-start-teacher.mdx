### Creating and Editing Exercises

Once all the steps above have been completed, you will have a folder called 
*"exercises"* .

Inside of the *"exercises"* file, as a teacher you must create a *"README.md"* file in order to advise the student what to do for the exercise.
 
Next, you must create an *"app.js"* folder where the student will be able to input their code to complete the exercise.

Lastly, you must create a *"test.js"* file where the automatic-test to grade the exercise will be located.


### Publishing

Once you have created all desired exercises along with the instructions and test file you can publish it for students to be able to access it and practice.

In order to publish, type the following command in your computer terminal:


```sh
$ learnpack publish
```
